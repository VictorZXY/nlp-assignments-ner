# A Neural Network Approach to Named Entity Recognition on Noisy User-Generated Text
Final assignment of my CST Part III Natural Language Processing (L90) module.

Named entity recognition (NER) is an important information extraction task in natural language processing (NLP) which involves automatic identification of entities of interest, such as peopleâ€™s names, organisations and locations. Recently, NER on standard, wellformed and highly predictable texts, such as news texts, has been remarkably successful. However, the diverse and noisy nature of user-generated texts as well as the novel, emerging and rare named entities make NER in social media much more challenging, and standard NER sysmtes were not found to work very well on these tasks. In this final practical, I investigated a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) structure for NER, explored various data-processing techniques in order to improve the model's performance, and evaluated my trained models on the W-NUT 2017 shared task on novel and emerging entity recognition. The model trained with data-processing techniques applied has achieved significant improvements on performance, compared to the same model trained using the original dataset without any optimisation.
