        "This session is the final one of our 3-part practical task.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Explore and annotate a named entity recognition dataset (worth 10%) [link to colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J_jXBEFfxbDDuI_NcJpZPmubpNQCG6Kf?usp=sharing)\n",

        "## Recap: Practical 1\n",
        "\n",
        "First let's look back at the first assignment from practical 1, when we asked you to annotate 50 tweets from the training set, now that we've received all your submissions. Hopefully you received some feedback on Moodle, including your agreement kappa with the original file (if not, let us know: apc38).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the agreement among the 26 of you was a Fleiss's kappa of .708 (= 'substantial' agreement per Landis & Koch 1977, 'The measurement of observer agreement for categorical data' -- this is pretty good for NLP annotation, in our experience).\n",
        "\n",
        "If we take the same max-recall approach as the task organisers did -- accepting all named entity labels (with a bit of downstream inspection) -- then we'd have a new training file in which there are 111 named entities (compared to 41 in the original file). If we instead take a majority vote approach then we'd have 47 named entities. So we could end up with quite different training data, with a greater variety of named entities identified, if we were to continue this group annotation process on the whole training file.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is obviously not complete agreement but it would be unrealistic to expect that for all but the most trivial of natural language annotation tasks, as you probably realise by now. The more practical question is: how do we handle the inevitable disagreements in language annotation? Note that besides the majority vote or max-recall ways of handling multiple annotation, there has been work on making use of disagreement as a useful training signal in computational modelling (for just one example see [Plank et al 2014](https://aclanthology.org/E14-1078/)), and also a review of how to use such information in evaluation ([Basile et al 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.bppf-1.3/)).\n",
        "\n",
        "There was one entity in the original file which you unanimously decided is not in fact a named entity: `vodka B-product`. And there were 16 word tokens which you labelled as being part of named entities, but which were not in the gold file:\n",

        "Most of these indeed seem to be named entities: it's not clear why 'Green Newsfeed', 'london fashion week', and 'eurovision' weren't identified as named entities in the original file (perhaps regional effects: recall that the training file annotator was US-based).\n",
        "\n",
        "'cody' is debatable, because it's clearly a person (the context: \"hopefully we got cody's ipod in the mail today\") but not as far as we know a well known person. So this touches on a philosophical problem with NER: at what point does someone become sufficiently widely known for them to be considered a _person_ in a named entity sense? (see also 'wood', someone's nickname: \"Wingo tellin me and wood...\").\n",
        "\n",
        "'1ST AVE HKY' appears to refer to an address in Hickory, North Carolina, USA (or at least: that's what a Google search indicates). The reason for this entity not being identified by the annotators is another common problem: that of local places not being generally known. In a sense, this is one way to decide if a location is of interest, by revealing how well-known it is: but this leads to a problem of bias relating to the geographical knowledge and experience of the annotators.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll let you look at the texts again and discuss these proposed additional named entities in your final report, if you wish to (no requirement, but it might enrich it). Here's the [sample file](https://storage.googleapis.com/wnut-2017_ner-shared-task/wnut17train_sample_blank.txt) again for convenience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, however high or low your agreement score with the original annotation, it's not so much a matter of 'correct' or 'incorrect', but more 'agreement' and 'disagreement'. What that tells us about language annotation, and what we do with disagreements, are the interesting questions we think."

We do have access to the test set in this shared task, so let's use the information available to us; but in some shared tasks you don't get access to the test set (which is why your code needs to be able to handle truncation as well as padding). Feel free to experiment with this sequence length in your assignment.\n",

Instead, the purpose of the assignment is to do a **close error analysis** of both your classifier from assignment 2 and this neural network classifier to some extent -- you can choose to focus more on one or the other, but both should be covered. Error analyses include but are not limited to: confusion matrices, examples of texts containing errors, discussion of why those named entities are not captured by the classifier in question. Discuss the errors with reference to the linguistic properties of the words involved. You might also reflect on the annotation process and the resulting training and dev files, based on your experience in assignment 1 and the group-level agreement / disagreement over named entities. Note that you are only required to undertake this analysis on the dev set, as we think there will be enough that's interesting to talk about in these texts alone. If you are short of things to talk about, you can extend to look at the test set too ([link to the annotated test set](https://storage.googleapis.com/wnut-2017_ner-shared-task/wnut17test_annotated_clean_tagged.txt)), but there's _no requirement_ to do so.\n",

The report should be structured like an experimental write up as follows: short introduction & background section, overview of models used, detail of methods / feature extraction / network properties, data description, evaluation method, results, discussion and conclusion.
